I will never use Opodo again.

Their continued feet dragging to ensure that I can't cancel my trip is perfect demonstration of the destructive nature of profit-driven capitalism.

Underpaid support agents that are trained in methods to prevent customers from canceling their trips and getting their money refunded. While middle managers slap themselves on the backs for finding yet another method for "hitting their numbers" at the expense of frustrated customers.

Why are flights and trips not treated like any other product I purchase at a store? I purchase, I don't like, I bring back and get my money back. No questions asked. Travel seems to be a special kind of magic product that can't be handled in that same way. Why? Since this is capitalism, the answer is pretty straight forward: profit and greed.

So continuing my frustrating issues with opodo. They are truly cynical and disrespecting to customers.

Having threatened their support team with dragging them to the court of social media, they finally cancelled my trip. It's ironic (and fun to observe) how large companies aren't afraid to destroy the lives of individuals but fear the wrath of the masses.

Either way, in their everlasting and never-ceasing greed, they refunded me a total of 8 Euros on a 3000 Euro trip. Claiming that the airline (Qatar) had such high cancellation costs.

Unfortunately that is not true. Qatars support was brilliant in helping me to cancel my check-in since opodo won't cancel my trip since I was checked in. So I had to call the airline to cancel that. While talking to their support, they told me that, at the moment due to covid, they have no cancellation fees.

So opodo lies me in the face. Claiming that the airline has such high cancellation fees.

But at least I did something useful with my 8 Euro refund, I bought a new domain: [www.nopodo.net](https://www.nopodo.net)

Thanks opodo for that.
