I will never use Opodo again.

Their continued feet dragging to ensure that I can't cancel my trip is perfect demonstration of the destructive nature of profit-driven capitalism.

Underpaid support agents that are trained in methods to prevent customers from canceling their trips and getting their money refunded. While middle managers slap themselves on the backs for finding yet another method for "hitting their numbers" at the expense of frustrated customers.

Why are flights and trips not treated like any other product I purchase at a store? I purchase, I don't like, I bring back and get my money back. No questions asked. Travel seems to be a special kind of magic product that can't be handled in that same way. Why? Since this is capitalism, the answer is pretty straight forward: profit and greed.
